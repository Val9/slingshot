<p>Slingshot provides a HTML/Mobile Web client and library for Microsoft SharePoint Server 2010.  Using jQuery Mobile, Slingshot makes it easy to expose tasks, appointments, documents, and other objects from any SharePoint 2010 instance to a mobile device.</p>

<p>You can even access features of your device, such as taking a picture on your phone, and uploading it to a document library.</p>

<h2>Quick Start</h2>

<ol>
<li><p>Clone the repository, 'git clone <a href="https://github.com/neudesic/slingshot.git">https://github.com/neudesic/slingshot.git</a>'</p></li>
<li><p>Modify the compat.browser file in SharePoint (often found in c:\inetpub\wwwroot\wss\VirtualDirectories\80\App_Browsers).  Locate the sections that apply to your devices, and set the isMobileDevice value to false.  An example of how to do this for the iPhone can be found in the Support folder.</p></li>
<li><p>Create a new virtual directory (e.g. slingshot) under the SharePoint route in Inetmgr, and add the index.html, Scripts, and Styles folders.</p></li>
</ol><p>Browse to http://yourserver/slingshot from your mobile device!</p>

<h2>FAQs</h2>

<p class="question">Q. What devices does Slingshot support today?</p>

<p>Slingshot supports all devices supported by jQuery Mobile (iOS, Android, Blackberry, Windows Phone 7).</p>

<p class="question">Q. How does authentication work with Slingshot?</p>

<p>Exactly the same as SharePoint does today (default is either NTLM or Basic auth).  We do have plans to support cached credentials and additional options.</p>

<p class="question">Q. Does Slingshot support any device-specific functionality?</p>

<p>Yes, using the <a href="http://github.com/neudesic/slingshot-cordova">Slingshot Cordova wrapper project</a>, you can upload photos from the device to a SharePoint document library.</p>

<p class="question">Q. What are the deployment options for Slingshot?</p>

<p>By default, you access Slingshot through your mobile browser, however by using the <a href="http://github.com/neudesic/slingshot-cordova">Slingshot Cordova wrapper project</a>, you can also create a native application that wraps the mobile content.</p>

<p class="question">Q. Does that mean I can deploy my SharePoint mobile app to the AppStore?</p>

<p>Technically, yes, however Apple's policy is to commonly reject internal, employee facing applications.  A more suitable approach might be to consider Apple's Enterprise Program.</p>
